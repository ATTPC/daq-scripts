# daq-scripts
This repository contains the scripts used to configure the DAQ system for the AT-TPC. 

The `daq-config` directory contains an [Ansible playbook](http://docs.ansible.com/index.html) that can be used
to configure (or reconfigure) the Mac Minis from scratch (assuming Fedora has already been installed on them).

The other scripts are there for convenience when running the system during experiments.
